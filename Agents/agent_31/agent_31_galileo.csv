The population was 199,723 at the 2020 census, while the Salt Lake City metropolitan area has an estimated 1.3 million residents and is the 46th-largest metropolitan area in the United States. It is also part of the larger Salt Lake City\u2013Ogden\u2013Provo combined statistical area, an urban corridor along a 120-mile (190 km) segment of the Wasatch Front with a population of approximately 2.8 million. It is one of the principal urban centers within the Great Basin, along with Reno, Nevada.\nSalt Lake City was founded in 1847 by settlers led by Brigham Young who were seeking to escape persecution they had experienced while living farther east. The Mormon pioneers, as they would come to be known, entered a semi-arid valley and immediately began building an extensive irrigation network that could feed the population and foster future growth. Salt Lake City's street grid system is based on a standard compass grid plan, with the southeast corner of Temple Square serving as the origin of the Salt Lake meridian. Owing to its proximity to the Great Salt Lake, the city was originally named Great Salt Lake City; the word \""Great\"" was dropped from the city's name in 1868. Immigration of international members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), mining booms, and the construction of the first transcontinental railroad brought economic growth, and the city was nicknamed \""The Crossroads of the West\"". It was traversed by the Lincoln Highway, the first transcontinental highway, in 1913. Two major cross-country freeways, I-15 and I-80, now intersect in the city. The city also has a belt route, I-215.\nSalt Lake City has developed a strong tourist industry based primarily on skiing, outdoor recreation, and religious tourism. It hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics and will host the 2034 Winter Olympics.

Construction of the Berlin Wall was commenced by the government of the GDR on 13 August 1961. It included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, accompanied by a wide area (later known as the \""death strip\"") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, beds of nails and other defenses. The primary intention for the Wall's construction was to prevent East German citizens from fleeing to the West.\nThe Soviet Bloc propaganda portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from \""fascist elements conspiring to prevent the will of the people\"" from building a communist state in the GDR. The authorities officially referred to the Berlin Wall as the Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart (German: Antifaschistischer Schutzwall, pronounced [antifa\u02cc\u0283\u026ast\u026a\u0283\u0250 \u02c8\u0283\u028atsval] ). Conversely, West Berlin's city government sometimes referred to it as the \""Wall of Shame\"", a term coined by mayor Willy Brandt in reference to the Wall's restriction on freedom of movement. Along with the separate and much longer inner German border, which demarcated the border between East and West Germany, it came to symbolize physically the Iron Curtain that separated the Western Bloc and Soviet satellite states of the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War.\nBefore the Wall's erection, 3.5 million East Germans (20% of the population) circumvented Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions and defected from the GDR, many by crossing over the border from East Berlin into West Berlin; from there they could then travel to West Germany and to other Western European countries. After 1961, the deadly force associated with the Wall prevented almost all such emigration. During this period, over 100,000 people attempted to escape, and over 5,000 people succeeded in escaping over the Wall, with an estimated death toll of those killed by East German authorities ranging from 136 to more than 200 in and around Berlin.\nIn 1989, a series of revolutions in nearby Eastern Bloc countries (Poland and Hungary in particular) and the events of the \""Pan-European Picnic\"" set in motion a peaceful development during which the Iron Curtain largely broke; rulers in the East came under public pressure to cease their repressive policies. After several weeks of civil unrest, the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit the FRG and West Berlin. Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the Wall, joined by West Germans on the other side, and souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the Wall over the next few weeks. The Brandenburg Gate section, a few meters from the Berlin Wall, reopened on 22 December 1989, with full demolition of the Wall beginning on 13 June 1990 and concluding in 1994. The fall of the Berlin Wall paved the way for German reunification, which formally took place on 3 October 1990.\n\nPage: Fall of the Berlin Wall\nSummary: The Berlin Wall fell on 9 November 1989 during the Peaceful Revolution, marking the beginning of the destruction of the figurative Iron Curtain, as East Berlin transit restrictions were overwhelmed and discarded.  Sections of the wall were breached, and planned deconstruction began the following June. It was one of the series of events that started the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe. The fall of the inner German border took place shortly afterward. An end to the Cold War was declared at the Malta Summit in early December, and German reunification took place in October the following year.\n\nPage: Berlin\nSummary: Berlin (  bur-LIN; German: [b\u025b\u0281\u02c8li\u02d0n] ) is the capital and largest city of Germany, by both area and population.

Purposely creating a literary contrast with the Achaemenid Empire, the great land-based power that ruled the east (what the Greeks called Asia), Plato describes Atlantis as a naval empire from the west that had conquered most of Europe and Libya, but then loses divine favor after an ill-fated campaign against a fictionalized Athens and subsequently submerges into the Atlantic Ocean. By portraying the victorious Athens in the image of his ideal state from the Republic, Plato intended the Atlantis story to bear witness to the superiority of his concept of a state.\nDespite its minor importance in Plato's work, the Atlantis story has had a considerable impact on literature. The allegorical aspect of Atlantis was taken up in utopian works of several Renaissance writers, such as Francis Bacon's New Atlantis and Thomas More's Utopia. On the other hand, nineteenth-century amateur scholars misinterpreted Plato's narrative as historical tradition, most famously Ignatius L. Donnelly in his Atlantis: The Antediluvian World. Plato's vague indications of the time of the events (more than 9,000 years before his time) and the alleged location of Atlantis (\""beyond the Pillars of Hercules\"") gave rise to much pseudoscientific speculation. As a consequence, Atlantis has become a byword for any and all supposed advanced prehistoric lost civilizations and continues to inspire contemporary fiction, from comic books to films.\nWhile present-day philologists and classicists agree on the story's fictional nature, there is still debate on what served as its inspiration. Plato is known to have freely borrowed some of his allegories and metaphors from older traditions, as he did with the story of Gyges. This led a number of scholars to suggest possible inspiration of Atlantis from Egyptian records of the Thera eruption, the Sea Peoples invasion, or the Trojan War. Others have rejected this chain of tradition as implausible and insist that Plato created an entirely fictional account, drawing loose inspiration from contemporary events such as the failed Athenian invasion of Sicily in 415\u2013413 BC or the destruction of Helike in 373 BC.\n\n\n\nPage: Space Shuttle Atlantis\nSummary: Space Shuttle Atlantis (Orbiter Vehicle designation: OV\u2011104) is a retired Space Shuttle orbiter vehicle which belongs to NASA, the spaceflight and space exploration agency of the United States. Atlantis was manufactured by the Rockwell International company in Southern California and was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center in Eastern Florida in April 1985. Atlantis is the fourth operational and the second-to-last Space Shuttle built. Its maiden flight was STS-51-J made from October 3 to 7, 1985.\nAtlantis embarked on its 33rd and final mission, also the final mission of a space shuttle, STS-135, on July 8, 2011. STS-134 by Endeavour was expected to be the final flight before STS-135 was authorized in October 2010. STS-135 took advantage of the processing for the STS-335 Launch on Need mission that would have been necessary if STS-134's crew became stranded in orbit. Atlantis landed for the final time at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011.\nBy the end of its final mission, Atlantis had orbited the Earth a total of 4,848 times, traveling nearly 126,000,000 mi (203,000,000 km), which is more than 525 times the distance from the Earth to the Moon.\nAtlantis is named after RV Atlantis, a two-masted sailing ship that operated as the primary research vessel for the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution from 1930 to 1966.\nThe space shuttle is now on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.\nThought:  This page does not provide information about the population of Atlantis.

The park was a major feature of Alan Bond's Yanchep Sun City plan. It closed in August 1990 due to a financial difficulty.\n\nPage: The New Atlantis (journal)\nSummary: The New Atlantis is a journal founded by the social conservative advocacy group the Ethics and Public Policy Center, now published by the Center for the Study of Technology and Society. It covers topics about the social, ethical, political, and policy dimensions of modern science and technology. The journal is editorially reviewed but is not peer-reviewed on scientific topics. It is edited by Ari Schulman, having previously been edited by co-founders Eric Cohen and Adam Keiper.\nThe journal's name is taken from Francis Bacon's utopian novella New Atlantis, which the journal's editors describe as a \""fable of a society living with the benefits and challenges of advanced science and technology\"". An editorial in the inaugural issue states that the aim of the journal is \""to help us avoid the extremes of euphoria and despair that new technologies too often arouse; and to help us judge when mobilizing our technological prowess is sensible or necessary, and when the preservation of things that count requires limiting the kinds of technological power that would lessen, cheapen, or ultimately destroy us.\"" Writing in National Review, the journal's editor Adam Keiper described The New Atlantis as being written from a \""particularly American and conservative way of thinking about both the blessings and the burdens of modern science and technology\"". New Atlantis authors and bioethicists publishing in other journals have also similarly referred to The New Atlantis as being written from a social conservative stance that utilizes religion.\n\nPage: Graham Hancock\nSummary: Graham Bruce Hancock (born 2 August 1950) is a British author who promotes pseudoscientific ideas about ancient civilizations and hypothetical lost lands. Hancock proposes that an advanced civilization with spiritual technology existed during the last Ice Age until it was destroyed following comet impacts around 12,900 years ago at the onset of the Younger Dryas. He speculates that survivors of this cataclysm passed on their knowledge to primitive hunter-gatherers around the world, giving rise to all the earliest known civilizations (such as ancient Egypt, Sumer, and Mesoamerica). \nBorn in Edinburgh, Hancock studied sociology at Durham University before working as a journalist, writing for a number of British newspapers and magazines. His first three books dealt with international development, including Lords of Poverty (1989), a well-received critique of corruption in the aid system. Beginning with The Sign and the Seal in 1992, he shifted focus to speculative accounts of human prehistory and ancient civilizations, on which he has written a dozen books, most notably Fingerprints of the Gods and Magicians of the Gods. \nExperts have described Hancock's investigations of archaeological evidence, myths and historical documents as superficially resembling investigative journalism but lacking in accuracy, consistency, and impartiality. They define his work as pseudoarchaeology and pseudohistory because they consider it to be biased towards preconceived conclusions by ignoring context, misrepresenting sources, cherry picking, and withholding critical counter-evidence. The anthropologist Jeb Card has described Hancock's writings as being paranormal in nature and his idea of an Ice Age civilization as a modern mythological narrative that, due to its emphasis on alleged secret and spiritual knowledge (including psychic abilities and communing with souls and \""powerful nonphysical beings\"" via the use of psychedelics), is incompatible with the archaeological scientific method.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 191,185. The county seat is Placerville. The county is part of the Sacramento-Roseville-Arden-Arcade, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is located entirely in the Sierra Nevada, from the historic Gold Country in the western foothills to the High Sierra in the east. El Dorado County's population has grown as Greater Sacramento has expanded into the region. Where the county line crosses US 50 at Clarksville, the distance to Sacramento is 15 miles (24 km). In the county's high altitude eastern end at Lake Tahoe, environmental awareness and environmental protection initiatives have grown along with the population since the 1960 Winter Olympics, hosted at the former Squaw Valley Ski Resort in neighboring Placer County.\n\nPage: El Dorado, Arkansas\nSummary: El Dorado (locally  el durr-AY-doh) is a city in and the county seat of Union County, on the southern border of Arkansas, United States.

Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, it has been described as \""the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, [and] the most parodied work of art in the world.\"" The painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression, monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism.\nThe painting has been traditionally considered to depict the Italian noblewoman Lisa del Giocondo. It is painted in oil on a white poplar panel. Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family. It was believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. King Francis I of France acquired the Mona Lisa after Leonardo's death in 1519, and it is now the property of the French Republic. It has normally been on display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797.\nThe painting's global fame and popularity partly stem from its 1911 theft by Vincenzo Peruggia, who attributed his actions to Italian patriotism\u2014a belief it should belong to Italy. The theft and subsequent recovery in 1914 generated unprecedented publicity for an art theft, and led to the publication of many cultural depictions such as the 1915 opera Mona Lisa, two early 1930s films (The Theft of the Mona Lisa and Ars\u00e8ne Lupin), and the song \""Mona Lisa\"" recorded by Nat King Cole\u2014one of the most successful songs of the 1950s.\nThe Mona Lisa is one of the most valuable paintings in the world.

Julia Roberts received a record $25 million for her performance, the highest ever earned by an actress at that time.\n\nPage: Mona Lisa (film)\nSummary: Mona Lisa is a 1986 British neo-noir crime drama film directed by Neil Jordan, and written by Jordan and David Leland. It was produced by HandMade Films and stars Bob Hoskins, Cathy Tyson, and Michael Caine. The film is about an ex-convict (Hoskins) who becomes entangled in the dangerous life of a high-class call girl (Tyson). \nThe film was nominated for multiple awards, and Hoskins was nominated for several awards for his performance (including the Academy Award for Best Actor), winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

This is a list of prime ministers of Japan, from when the first Japanese prime minister (in the modern sense), It\u014d Hirobumi, took office in 1885, until the present day.\n32 prime ministers under the Meiji Constitution had a mandate from the Emperor. The \""electoral mandates\"" shown are for the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Imperial Diet, which was not constitutionally guaranteed to have any influence on the appointment of the prime minister.\nThe prime minister under the Constitution of Japan is designated from among the members of the National Diet, and appointed by the Emperor after being nominated by the National Diet.\nThe prime ministership of Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, who was prime minister for fifty-four days in 1945, was the shortest in Japanese history. Shinzo Abe served the longest, with eight years over two non-consecutive periods.\nThe current prime minister is Shigeru Ishiba, who stated his intention to resign on 7 September 2025. There are currently 12 living former prime ministers. The most recent former prime minister to die, Shinzo Abe, was assassinated on 8 July 2022.\n\n\n\nPage: Prime Minister of Japan\nSummary: The prime minister of Japan (\u5185\u95a3\u7dcf\u7406\u5927\u81e3, Naikaku S\u014dri Daijin; Japanese pronunciation: [na\ua71ci.ka.k\u026f | so\u02d0.\u027e\u02b2i da\ua71ci.d\u0291i\u0274]) is the head of government of Japan. The prime minister chairs the Cabinet of Japan and has the ability to select and dismiss its ministers of state. The prime minister also serves as the commander-in-chief of the Japan Self Defence Forces. \nThe National Diet (parliament) nominates the prime minister from among its members (typically from among the members of the House of Representatives). He is then formally appointed by the emperor. The prime minister must retain the confidence of the House of Representatives to remain in office. The prime minister lives and works at the Naikaku S\u014dri Daijin Kantei (Prime Minister's Official Residence) in Nagatach\u014d, Chiyoda, Tokyo, close to the National Diet Building. \nSixty-five men have served as prime minister, the first of whom was It\u014d Hirobumi taking office on 22 December 1885. The longest-serving prime minister was Shinzo Abe, who served over eight years, and the shortest-serving was Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, who served fifty-four days. The last prime minister was Shigeru Ishiba, who succeeded Fumio Kishida on 1 October 2024, following the 2024 Liberal Democratic Party presidential election. He announced his resignation on 7 September 2025, effective when a successor is chosen.\n\nPage: List of prime ministers of Canada\nSummary: The prime minister of Canada is the official who serves as the primary minister of the Crown, chair of the Cabinet, and thus head of government of Canada. Twenty-four people (twenty-three men and one woman) have served as prime minister. Officially, the prime minister is appointed by the governor general of Canada, but by constitutional convention, the prime minister must have the confidence of the elected House of Commons. Normally, this is the leader of the party caucus with the greatest number of seats in the house. However, in a minority parliament the leader of an opposition party may be asked to form a government if the incumbent government resigns and the governor general is persuaded that they have the confidence of the House. \nBy constitutional convention, a prime minister holds a seat in parliament and, since the early 20th century, this has more specifically meant the House of Commons.\nThe 24th and current prime minister is Mark Carney, who assumed office on 14 March 2025. There are currently six living former prime ministers. The most recent former prime minister to die was Brian Mulroney, on 29 February 2024.\nThought: "", ""role"": ""user""}]","{""text"": "" I now know the final answer.\nFinal Answer: The current Prime Minister of Japan is Shigeru Ishiba and the weather forecast for Tokyo tomorrow cannot be retrieved due to a data corruption issue."", ""generation_info"": {""finish_reason"": ""stop"", ""logprobs"": null}}",1.0,1.0
