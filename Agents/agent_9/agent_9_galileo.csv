The reason basically comes down to \""taking an n-th root\"" not a priori being a well-defined operation on complex numbers (there is no \""preferred choice\"" for the n-th root in general, and you have n different options to choose from generally), and requiring a bunch of choices. After those, it\\'s still not a continuous operation, so you\\'ll have a sudden \""jump\"" in the outcomes at some place. All in all, a rule like zab=(za)b simply cannot hold then anymore. It holds in some special cases though. Edit: maybe good to say: the fact that we need all these choices to talk about n-th roots means that, for a fixed complex, non-real number z, the operation C->C, w->zw is not even defined before you make clear which choices you make.

It has since been deleted, but here is my answer to that other question, which is also pertinent here. We say x is a \""square root\"" of y if x2=y. Thus, both +7 and \u22127 are square roots of 49. However for positive reals x, by definition the square root function applied to x yields the positive square root. Often one will abbreviate \""the square root function applied to x\"" or equivalently \""the positive square root of x\"" as simply \""the square root of x,\"" if no confusion should arise. Therefore we have \u221a49=+7, despite \u22127 also being a square root.
